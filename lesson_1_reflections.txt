How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
by comparing only the changes, I can find quicker my bug. No need to compare the whole files.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can see how changes envolved. I can revert to older versions.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pro: creating logical commits
contra: human mistakes, forgetting to commit
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
cause of relations beetween files, logical changes might affect several files
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to show the list of commits and diff to see the difference done by a commit
