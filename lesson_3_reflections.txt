When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I want to collaberate with other people or working from different machines.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it is easier to see and reflect the changes that are coming in. No magical changes in the background of my codebase.
